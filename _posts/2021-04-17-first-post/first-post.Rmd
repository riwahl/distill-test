The lifespan (denoted as $t$) of 100 lamps has been measured. Each lamp has been used with an intensity (denoted as $s$) from 0 to 1, where 0 is turned off and 1 is maximum capacity. 

It is known that lamps of the type relevant here has a lifespan $t$ that is exponentially distributed and where the expected value is 

$$\mu(s) = \frac{\beta}{s}, \quad s > 0,$$

where $\beta > 0$ is an unknown parameter and $s$ equals the intensity with which the lamp has been used.
